Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. 
Once sorted, print the following 3 lines:
  1. "Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps" where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
  2. "First Element: firstElement" where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
  3. "Last Element: lastElement" where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
